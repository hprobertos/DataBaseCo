I do not earn money from this and the only purpose of it was to complete the corresponding course.

## History of the software
The point of the software is to simulate a real company, where employees, clients and products need to be registered in a Data Base, with the ability to add, modify and delete elements. Also, it has procedures like print receipt, order, automatic scheduling, etc.

## How to use
ItÂ´s pretty simple, you have buttons in the UI to add new employees and products as a Administrator or you can use the software as a Employee that makes as a cashier.

## Compatibility 
This game was developed to run in computers with Windows 7 or above, it won't run in computers that are not windows.

## Credit
You have all rights to use it as you wish, but I will be so grateful if you credit me for my hard work. Have fun!
